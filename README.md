# SkillBridge

SkillBridge is a platform designed to bridge the gap between new graduates and students seeking practical experience and businesses/nonprofits needing short-term, specific tasks completed. Our mission is to empower emerging talent by providing opportunities to build verifiable portfolios and enhance their employability in a competitive job market.

## Problem Addressed

New graduates and students often struggle to gain essential practical experience due to a saturated job market and limited internship opportunities. This lack of real-world application can put them at a disadvantage when seeking entry-level positions.

## Our Solution

SkillBridge offers a dynamic micro-project marketplace where:

*   **Businesses and Nonprofits** can post well-defined, small-scale projects requiring specific skills.
*   **Students and New Grads** can discover, apply for, and complete these projects, building a verifiable history of practical experience.

## Key Features and Interventions

*   **Micro-Project Marketplace Platform:** A centralized online hub for posting and discovering micro-projects.
*   **Verified Skill-Building and Portfolio Creation:** A system to verify project completion, which translates into tangible portfolio credit.
*   **Incentive Framework:** Facilitation of optional small stipends for successful project completion.
*   **Skill and Achievement Recognition System:** A badge system to motivate users and visually represent their accumulated skills and milestones.
