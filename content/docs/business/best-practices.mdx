Learn from successful organizations on SkillBridge to maximize your results and create positive experiences.

## Project Definition

### Scope Projects Appropriately

**✅ Good Project Scope:**
- Can be completed in stated timeframe
- Has clear, measurable deliverables
- Appropriate for student skill level
- Provides learning value
- Benefits your organization

**❌ Poor Project Scope:**
- Unrealistically large for timeline
- Vague or constantly changing goals
- Requires professional-level expertise
- Just menial tasks with no learning
- Mission-critical with tight deadlines

### Set Clear Expectations

**Define Upfront:**
- Specific deliverables
- Quality standards
- Timeline and milestones
- Communication frequency
- Revision process
- Success criteria

## Student Support

### Provide Mentorship

**Be Available:**
- Schedule regular check-ins
- Respond to questions promptly
- Offer guidance proactively
- Share expertise and experience

**Support Learning:**
- Explain the "why" behind decisions
- Share industry best practices
- Provide constructive feedback
- Encourage growth and experimentation

### Give Useful Feedback

**Effective Feedback is:**
- Specific, not general
- Timely, not delayed
- Balanced (positive + constructive)
- Actionable, with clear next steps
- Respectful and professional

**Example:**
```
"The color palette you chose works well with our brand! For the 
layout, let's adjust: (1) increase the header size for better 
hierarchy, (2) add more whitespace between sections for readability. 
These changes will improve user flow. Can you have revisions ready 
by Friday?"
```

## Communication Excellence
