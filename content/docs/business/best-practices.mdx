# Best Practices for Businesses

Learn from successful organizations on SkillBridge to maximize your results and create positive experiences.

## Project Definition

### Scope Projects Appropriately

<Tabs items={['Good Project Scope', 'Poor Project Scope']}>
  <Tab value="Good Project Scope">
    **Characteristics of Well-Scoped Projects:**
    - Can be completed in stated timeframe
    - Has clear, measurable deliverables
    - Appropriate for student skill level
    - Provides learning value
    - Benefits your organization
    
    **Example:** "Design a 5-page marketing website with provided content and brand guidelines over 6 weeks"
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Poor Project Scope">
    **Red Flags to Avoid:**
    - Unrealistically large for timeline
    - Vague or constantly changing goals
    - Requires professional-level expertise
    - Just menial tasks with no learning
    - Mission-critical with tight deadlines
    
    **Example:** "Build a full e-commerce platform with payment processing and inventory management in 3 weeks"
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Set Clear Expectations

<Callout type="info" title="Define These Upfront">
  **Essential Project Elements:**
  - Specific deliverables
  - Quality standards
  - Timeline and milestones
  - Communication frequency
  - Revision process
  - Success criteria
</Callout>

Document all expectations in your project posting and confirm during the kickoff meeting. Clear expectations prevent misunderstandings and set students up for success.

## Student Support

### Provide Mentorship

<Tabs items={['Availability', 'Learning Support']}>
  <Tab value="Availability">
    **Be Available:**
    - Schedule regular check-ins (weekly or bi-weekly)
    - Respond to questions promptly (within 24-48 hours)
    - Offer guidance proactively (don't wait for students to struggle)
    - Share expertise and experience from your industry
    
    **Recommended:** Set office hours or standing meetings for consistent support.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Learning Support">
    **Support Learning:**
    - Explain the "why" behind decisions and requirements
    - Share industry best practices and standards
    - Provide constructive feedback with specific examples
    - Encourage growth and controlled experimentation
    
    **Remember:** The goal is education, not just deliverables.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Give Useful Feedback

**Effective Feedback is:**
- **Specific, not general:** Point to exact elements or sections
- **Timely, not delayed:** Provide feedback within 2-3 days
- **Balanced:** Include positive observations and constructive improvements
- **Actionable:** Give clear next steps students can implement
- **Respectful and professional:** Maintain encouraging tone

<Tabs items={['Good Feedback Example', 'Poor Feedback Example']}>
  <Tab value="Good Feedback Example">
    ```
    "The color palette you chose works well with our brand! For the 
    layout, let's adjust: (1) increase the header size for better 
    hierarchy, (2) add more whitespace between sections for readability. 
    These changes will improve user flow. Can you have revisions ready 
    by Friday?"
    ```
    
    **Why This Works:** Specific, balanced, actionable, includes timeline
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Poor Feedback Example">
    ```
    "The design doesn't look right. Please fix it and make it better."
    ```
    
    **Why This Fails:** Vague, no specific direction, no positive feedback, unclear timeline
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Communication Excellence

### Maintain Responsiveness

<Callout type="warn" title="Response Time Goals">
  Meeting these timelines builds trust and keeps projects moving:
  - **Initial inquiry:** Within 24 hours
  - **Application decision:** Within 1 week
  - **Project questions:** Within 24-48 hours
  - **Milestone reviews:** Within 2-3 days
</Callout>

Consistent responsiveness demonstrates professionalism and respect for students' time.

### Be Professional Yet Approachable

**Tone Guidelines:**
- **Friendly but professional:** Maintain warmth without being overly casual
- **Clear and direct:** Avoid ambiguity, state expectations plainly
- **Respectful and courteous:** Remember you're mentoring developing professionals
- **Encouraging and supportive:** Celebrate progress and guide through challenges

## Timeline Management

### Build in Buffer Time

<Callout type="info" title="Realistic Scheduling">
  **Always include buffers for:**
  - Add 20-30% buffer to initial time estimates
  - Account for 1-2 rounds of revisions
  - Consider student schedules (exams, holidays, other coursework)
  - Plan for unexpected delays and learning curves
</Callout>

Students are balancing multiple commitments. Flexible, realistic timelines lead to better outcomes.

### Establish Milestones

**Effective Milestones:**
- **Break project into 2-4 phases** for manageable progress
- **Each milestone has clear deliverable** that can be reviewed independently
- **Regular progress checkpoints** (weekly or bi-weekly)
- **Opportunity for feedback and adjustment** before proceeding

**Example:** 6-week website project might have: (1) Wireframes & design mockups - Week 2, (2) Homepage & navigation - Week 4, (3) Remaining pages & final revisions - Week 6

## Compensation & Recognition

### Fair Compensation
