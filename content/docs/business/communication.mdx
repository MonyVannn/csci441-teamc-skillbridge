## Communication Best Practices

### Provide Clear, Specific Feedback

<Tabs items={["Vague Feedback", "Specific Feedback"]}>
<Tab value="Vague Feedback">

**Ineffective Example:**
"The design needs work."

**Problems:**
- No specific direction for improvement
- Student doesn't know what to change
- Creates confusion and frustration
- Leads to unnecessary revision cycles

</Tab>

<Tab value="Specific Feedback">

**Effective Example:**
"The color scheme looks great and aligns well with our brand guidelines! For the homepage layout, could you make these specific adjustments:

1. Increase the hero image size by approximately 20% to create more visual impact
2. Move the primary call-to-action button above the fold so it's immediately visible
3. Reduce the padding around the testimonials section by 10px for tighter spacing

These changes will help improve visual hierarchy and user engagement. Can you have these revisions ready by Friday?"

**Why It Works:**
- Starts with positive feedback
- Provides specific, measurable changes
- Explains the reasoning behind requests
- Sets clear timeline for revisions

</Tab>

### Maintain Timely Responsiveness

**Response Time Standards:**
- Respond to messages within 24 hours (business days)
- Review submitted work within 2-3 business days
- Provide advance notice if you'll be unavailable
- Set clear deadlines for your own feedback delivery

### Professional Tone Maintenance

**Effective Professional Communication:**
- Maintain respectful and courteous language consistently
- Use appropriate professional vocabulary and style
- Express genuine appreciation for good work and effort
- Deliver constructive criticism with specific improvement guidance

**Communication to Avoid:**
- Aggressive, demanding, or condescending language
- Personal comments unrelated to work
- Treating students as if they should already know everything
- Forgetting this is primarily a learning experience

### Establish Expectations Early

**Initial Communication Should Cover:**
- Preferred primary communication method and platform
- Expected response time for different types of inquiries
- Regular meeting schedule and format
- Your available working hours and time zone
- Protocol for handling urgent issues or blockers

## Handling Challenging Situations

2. **Wait Period**: Allow 48 hours for response
3. **Second Message** (After 48 hours): Send message expressing concern and offering support if they're facing challenges
4. **Final Action** (After 5 days total): If still no response, consider activating backup plan or reaching out through alternative contact method

### Work Quality Issues

**Constructive Approach:**

1. Provide specific, actionable feedback on exactly what needs improvement
2. Offer relevant resources, examples, or guidance to support improvement
3. Set clear expectations for next submission quality
4. Reflect on whether project scope and requirements were appropriately matched to student level

### Timeline Conflicts

**Resolution Process:**

1. Discuss conflicts openly and as early as possible
2. Collaboratively adjust milestones if circumstances are reasonable
3. Consider reducing project scope to fit available time
4. Document any mutually agreed changes in writing
5. Update project timeline in dashboard
