# Posting Projects

Creating clear, well-defined project postings is essential for attracting qualified students and ensuring successful collaborations on SkillBridge.

## Before You Post

### Project Readiness Assessment

Evaluate your project's readiness by considering these critical factors:

**Scope Definition**
Can you describe the project clearly in 2-3 paragraphs? Are deliverables specific and measurable? Is the proposed timeline realistic given the scope and student availability?

**Requirement Clarity**
Do you know precisely what skills are required? Can you distinguish between must-have and nice-to-have qualifications? Is the time commitment reasonable for student schedules?

**Support Capacity**
Do you have sufficient time to provide guidance and mentorship? Can you respond to questions promptly and give constructive feedback? Are necessary resources, tools, and access available?

**Student Appropriateness**
Can the project be completed within the stated timeline? Does it provide genuine learning opportunities beyond routine tasks? Will it add meaningful value to the student's portfolio and career development?

<Callout title="Planning Before Posting" type="warn">
If you cannot confidently answer yes to these questions, invest more time in project planning before creating your posting. Well-planned projects attract better candidates and achieve superior outcomes.
</Callout>

### Project Size Guidelines

Choose appropriate scope for student projects:

| Project Type | Duration | Hours/Week | Best Applications |
|-------------|----------|------------|-------------------|
| **Micro** | 2-4 weeks | 5-10 hours | First-time projects, simple defined tasks |
| **Small** | 1-2 months | 10-15 hours | Standard projects, specific deliverables |
| **Medium** | 2-3 months | 15-20 hours | Complex projects, experienced students |
| **Large** | 3-6 months | 20+ hours | Major initiatives, advanced students |

Start with smaller projects until you develop familiarity with managing student collaborations on the platform.


## Creating Your Project Posting

### Accessing the Project Creation Form

1. Log in to your organization account
2. Navigate to Dashboard → Projects
3. Click the Post New Project button
4. Complete the project creation form with all required information

### Project Title Guidelines

**Technical Requirements:**
- Length: 5-10 words optimal
- Format: Clear, descriptive, and specific
- Tone: Professional yet engaging

<Tabs items={["Good Examples", "Poor Examples"]}>
<Tab value="Good Examples">

**Effective Project Titles:**
- "Redesign Marketing Website Homepage"

These titles start with action verbs, include key deliverables, mention relevant technologies or platforms, and specify the outcome.

</Tab>

<Tab value="Poor Examples">

**Ineffective Project Titles:**
- "Need Help" - Too vague, no information
- "URGENT: WEBSITE DEVELOPER NEEDED!!!" - Overly aggressive, unprofessional
- "Looking for Someone to Do Some Coding Stuff" - Unprofessional, unclear

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Project Category Selection

Select the most accurate category for your project to ensure students can find it:

**Available Categories:**
- **Web Development**: Websites, web applications, frontend and backend work
- **Mobile Development**: iOS, Android, and cross-platform mobile apps

<Callout title="Category Importance" type="info">
Category selection significantly affects discoverability. Students often filter searches by category, so accurate categorization ensures your project reaches the right audience.
</Callout>


### Project Description Structure

The project description is the most critical component of your posting. Structure it clearly and comprehensively:

**Recommended Three-Part Structure:**

**Part 1: Project Overview** (2-3 sentences)
What is the project? What problem does it solve? Why does it matter to your organization?

**Part 2: Detailed Description** (2-3 paragraphs)
Background context and current situation, clear goals and objectives, expected outcomes and impact

**Part 3: Specific Tasks** (Bulleted list)
List 5-10 concrete, measurable tasks or deliverables, include any project milestones

**Project: Nonprofit Website Homepage Redesign**

**Overview:**
We need to redesign and rebuild the homepage of our nonprofit's website to better communicate our mission and improve user engagement. The current site has a 60% bounce rate, and we aim to reduce that while increasing newsletter signups.

**Detailed Description:**
Our organization, Community Garden Initiative, has been using the same website design since 2018. While functional, it no longer reflects our growth and doesn't effectively showcase our impact. Analytics show visitors leave quickly, and we receive few inquiries through the contact form.

We're seeking a student with web development experience to redesign and implement a new homepage. You'll work closely with our communications director to understand our brand, review user analytics, and create a more engaging, conversion-focused design. The new homepage should be mobile-responsive, accessible, and integrate with our existing WordPress backend.

This project offers hands-on experience in client communication, user-centered design, and modern web development practices. You'll have creative freedom within our brand guidelines and direct access to our team for feedback and support.

**Specific Tasks:**
- Conduct brief stakeholder interview to understand goals
- Review existing analytics and user behavior data
- Create wireframes and mockups for new homepage design
- Develop responsive homepage using HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Integrate with existing WordPress site
- Implement contact form and newsletter signup
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Optimize for page load speed and SEO
- Test across devices and browsers
- Provide documentation for future maintenance

**Project: Social Media Strategy and Content Calendar**

**Overview:**
Create a comprehensive social media content calendar and engagement strategy for our small business's Instagram and Facebook accounts to increase brand awareness and customer engagement.

**Detailed Description:**
TechForward Inc. is a B2B software company that has grown organically but lacks a consistent social media presence. We post sporadically and without strategy, resulting in low engagement and minimal follower growth. We want to change that.

We're seeking a marketing student to develop and implement a 3-month social media strategy. You'll research our target audience (small business owners and operations managers), analyze competitor social media, and create a content calendar with ready-to-post content. You'll also establish metrics to track success and provide recommendations for future strategy.

This is a great opportunity to build your portfolio with real business results, learn B2B marketing strategy, and gain experience in social media management tools.

**Specific Tasks:**
- Conduct audience research and competitive analysis
- Define social media goals and KPIs
- Create 3-month content calendar (60-90 posts)
- Write compelling copy for each post
- Design or source visual content (templates provided)
- Establish posting schedule and frequency
- Set up basic social media analytics tracking
- Create engagement response guidelines
- Schedule first month of posts
- Provide monthly analytics reports
- Document strategy for future reference

## Best Practices for Effective Postings

### Writing Clear Descriptions

**Effective Practices:**
- Use clear, concise language accessible to students
- Break text into digestible short paragraphs
- Utilize bullet points for lists and requirements
- Include specific, measurable deliverables
- Explain the purpose and context behind the project
- Highlight genuine learning and growth opportunities

**Practices to Avoid:**
- Excessive jargon or unexplained acronyms
- Long, dense paragraphs without visual breaks
- Vague descriptions of expectations and deliverables
- Demanding professional-level work without adequate support
- Unrealistic timeline promises that set projects up for failure
- Publishing without proofreading for errors and clarity

### Attracting Quality Applications

**Clear Requirements Lead to Better Matches**
Specific skill requirements help students self-filter appropriately. Clear timelines prevent schedule mismatches. Honest project scope attracts candidates at the right skill level.

**Sell the Opportunity Effectively**
Emphasize learning and professional growth opportunities. Highlight the portfolio value of the work. Mention available mentorship and support structures. Explain the real-world impact and significance.

**Maintain Authenticity**
Avoid overselling or making unrealistic promises. Be transparent about project challenges. Acknowledge if your organization is also learning. Demonstrate your organization's genuine personality and culture.


## Common Posting Mistakes to Avoid

<Tabs items={["Too Vague", "Unrealistic Scope", "Demanding Too Much", "Missing Information"]}>
<Tab value="Too Vague">

**Problem Example:**
"Looking for a developer to help with our website and maybe some other projects. Must know coding."

**Why This Fails:**
No specific deliverables, unclear scope, vague skill requirements, unprofessional presentation

**Improved Version:**
"Redesign company homepage using React to improve mobile responsiveness and reduce current 45% bounce rate. Must have intermediate JavaScript and React skills with portfolio demonstrating responsive design work."

</Tab>

<Tab value="Unrealistic Scope">

**Problem Example:**
"Build complete e-commerce platform with user accounts, payment processing, inventory management, and admin dashboard. Timeline: 4 weeks at 10 hours per week."

**Why This Fails:**
Professional-level work scope with student timeline, no consideration for learning curve, expectations misaligned with reality

**Improved Version:**
"Develop prototype for e-commerce product catalog page using React and mock data. Timeline: 6 weeks at 12 hours per week. Full implementation will be handled by our development team; this prototype is for concept validation and user testing."

</Tab>

<Tab value="Demanding Too Much">

**Problem Example:**
"Need expert full-stack developer for mission-critical production application. Must have 3+ years professional experience. Unpaid position."

**Why This Fails:**
Expects professional expertise from students, critical business application without compensation, unrealistic experience requirements

**Improved Version:**
"Seeking intermediate student to build admin dashboard prototype for our internal tool. Great learning opportunity with senior developer mentorship providing code reviews and guidance. $750 stipend upon completion."

</Tab>

<Tab value="Missing Information">

**Problem Example:**
"Marketing help needed. Start ASAP."

**What's Missing:**
Specific tasks undefined, required skills not listed, no timeline provided, deliverables unclear, virtually all critical information absent

**Complete Version Should Include:**
