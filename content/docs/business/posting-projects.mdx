# Posting Projects

Creating clear, well-defined project postings is essential for attracting qualified students and ensuring successful collaborations.

## Before You Post

### Is Your Project Ready?

Ask yourself these questions:

✅ **Is the scope well-defined?**
- Can you describe the project in 2-3 paragraphs?
- Are deliverables specific and measurable?
- Is the timeline realistic?

✅ **Are requirements clear?**
- Do you know what skills are needed?
- Can you list must-have vs. nice-to-have qualifications?
- Is the time commitment realistic?

✅ **Can you support the student?**
- Do you have time to provide guidance?
- Can you answer questions and give feedback?
- Are necessary resources available?

✅ **Is this appropriate for students?**
- Can it be completed within the timeline?
- Is it a learning opportunity, not just grunt work?
- Does it provide real value to the student's portfolio?

> **💡 Tip**: If you answered "no" to any question, spend more time planning before posting!

### Project Size Guidelines

Choose the right scope for student projects:

| Project Type | Duration | Hours/Week | Best For |
|-------------|----------|------------|----------|
| **Micro** | 2-4 weeks | 5-10 hours | First-time projects, simple tasks |
| **Small** | 1-2 months | 10-15 hours | Standard projects, specific deliverables |
| **Medium** | 2-3 months | 15-20 hours | Complex projects, experienced students |
| **Large** | 3-6 months | 20+ hours | Major initiatives, advanced students |

> **⚠️ Warning**: Start with smaller projects until you're comfortable with the process!

#### 3. Project Description

This is the heart of your posting. Structure it clearly:

**Recommended Structure:**

**Part 1: Project Overview (2-3 sentences)**
- What is the project?
- What problem does it solve?

**Example: Web Development Project**
```
**Overview:**
We need to redesign and rebuild the homepage of our nonprofit's 
website to better communicate our mission and improve user 
engagement. The current site has a 60% bounce rate, and we want 
to reduce that while increasing newsletter signups.

**Detailed Description:**
Our organization, Community Garden Initiative, has been using the 
same website design since 2018. While functional, it no longer 
reflects our growth and doesn't effectively showcase our impact. 
Analytics show visitors leave quickly, and we receive few inquiries 
through the contact form.

We're looking for a student with web development experience to 
redesign and implement a new homepage. You'll work closely with 
our communications director to understand our brand, review user 
analytics, and create a more engaging, conversion-focused design. 
The new homepage should be mobile-responsive, accessible, and 
integrate with our existing WordPress backend.

This project offers hands-on experience in client communication, 
user-centered design, and modern web development practices. You'll 
have creative freedom within our brand guidelines and direct access 
to our team for feedback and support.

**Specific Tasks:**
• Conduct brief stakeholder interview to understand goals
• Review existing analytics and user behavior data
• Create wireframes and mockups for new homepage design
• Develop responsive homepage using HTML, CSS, JavaScript
• Integrate with existing WordPress site
• Implement contact form and newsletter signup
• Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
• Optimize for page load speed and SEO
• Test across devices and browsers
• Provide documentation for future maintenance
```

**Example: Marketing Project**
```
**Overview:**
Create a comprehensive social media content calendar and 
engagement strategy for our small business's Instagram and 
Facebook accounts to increase brand awareness and customer 
engagement.

**Detailed Description:**
TechForward Inc. is a B2B software company that has grown 
organically but lacks a consistent social media presence. We post 
sporadically and without strategy, resulting in low engagement 
and minimal follower growth. We want to change that.

We're seeking a marketing student to develop and implement a 
3-month social media strategy. You'll research our target audience 
(small business owners and operations managers), analyze competitor 
social media, and create a content calendar with ready-to-post 
content. You'll also establish metrics to track success and 
provide recommendations for future strategy.

This is a great opportunity to build your portfolio with real 
business results, learn B2B marketing strategy, and gain 
experience in social media management tools.

**Specific Tasks:**
• Conduct audience research and competitive analysis
• Define social media goals and KPIs
• Create 3-month content calendar (60-90 posts)
• Write compelling copy for each post
• Design or source visual content (templates provided)
• Establish posting schedule and frequency
• Set up basic social media analytics tracking
• Create engagement response guidelines
• Schedule first month of posts
• Provide monthly analytics reports
• Document strategy for future reference
```

#### 5. Timeline & Commitment

- Flexibility: Is timeline negotiable?

**Time Commitment:**

- ✅ Highlight learning opportunities

**Don't:**

**Be Authentic**
- Don't oversell or make false promises
- Be honest about challenges
- Admit if you're learning too
- Show your organization's personality

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Too Broad or Vague
**Problem:**
```
"Looking for a developer to help with our website and maybe some 
other projects. Must know coding."
```

**Better:**
```
"Redesign company homepage using React to improve mobile 
responsiveness and reduce bounce rate. Must have intermediate 
JavaScript and React skills."
```

### ❌ Unrealistic Scope
**Problem:**
```
"Build complete e-commerce platform with user accounts, payment 
processing, inventory management, and admin dashboard. Timeline: 
4 weeks, 10 hours/week."
```

**Why it's a problem:**
- Impossible timeline for scope
- Professional-level work for student hours
- No consideration for learning curve

**Better:**
```
"Develop prototype for e-commerce product catalog page using 
React and mock data. Timeline: 6 weeks, 12 hours/week. Full 
implementation will be handled by our team; this is for concept 
validation."
```

### ❌ Demanding Professional Work for Free
**Problem:**
```
"Need expert full-stack developer for mission-critical production 
application. Must have 3+ years experience. Unpaid."
```

**Why it's a problem:**
- Expects professional expertise
- Critical business application
- No compensation for demanding work

**Better:**
```
"Seeking intermediate student to build admin dashboard prototype 
for our internal tool. Great learning opportunity with senior 
developer mentorship. $750 stipend."
```

### ❌ Missing Key Information
**Problem:**
```
"Marketing help needed. Start ASAP."
```

**What's missing:**
- Specific tasks
- Required skills
- Timeline
- Deliverables
- Virtually everything!
