    - **Keywords** - Search project titles and descriptions
    - **Categories** - Web Development, Design, Marketing, etc.

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How many projects can I apply to?">
    There's no hard limit on applications, but we recommend quality over quantity:
    
    - **Beginners:** Apply to 3-5 well-matched projects
    - **Experienced students:** Apply to 2-3 at a time
    - **Focus on fit:** Only apply to projects where you meet the requirements
    
    Customized applications to well-matched projects have much higher success rates than mass applications. Each application should be thoughtfully tailored to the specific project and organization.

    1. Go to **Dashboard** → **Applications**

    4. Select a reason and optionally add a message
    5. Confirm withdrawal
    
    <Callout type="warn">
      Withdrawal is final and cannot be undone. Always withdraw professionally if your circumstances change - don't just ghost the organization.
    </Callout>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How will I know if my application is accepted?">
    You'll be notified through multiple channels:
    
    - **Email notification** to your registered email

    **Typical Timeline:**
    - Initial review: 3-7 days
    - Interview invitation: 1-2 weeks
