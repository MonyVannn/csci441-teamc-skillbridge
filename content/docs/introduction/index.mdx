SkillBridge is a comprehensive platform designed to bridge the gap between students and new graduates seeking practical experience and businesses and nonprofits needing specific, short-term projects completed.

## The Problem We Solve

New graduates and students today face significant challenges entering the professional workforce:

<Cards>
  <Card title="Limited Practical Experience">
    The transition from academic learning to real-world application remains difficult without hands-on opportunities.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Saturated Job Market">
    Entry-level positions are increasingly competitive, requiring experience that new graduates often lack.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Internship Scarcity">
    Traditional internship opportunities are limited, highly competitive, and geographically constrained.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Portfolio Gap">
    Students struggle to build verifiable portfolios that effectively demonstrate their skills to employers.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Our Mission

Empower emerging talent by providing opportunities to build verifiable portfolios and enhance employability in a competitive job market while connecting organizations with skilled individuals who can complete specific, well-defined projects.

<Callout title="Core Principle" type="success">
