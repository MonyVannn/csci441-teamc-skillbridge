## Email Verification

### Why Verification Matters

Email verification ensures account security, enables important notifications, prevents spam accounts, and confirms you have access to the provided email address.

### Verification Process

**Check Your Inbox**

Look for an email from SkillBridge (noreply@skillbridge.com) with the subject "Verify Your SkillBridge Account." Emails typically arrive within 2-5 minutes.

**Complete Verification**

Click the Verify Email button in the message or copy the verification link into your browser. You'll be redirected to SkillBridge with a success confirmation.

### Troubleshooting Verification

If the verification email doesn't arrive, check these common issues:

1. Spam or junk folder — emails sometimes get filtered incorrectly
2. Promotions tab in Gmail — check this category
3. Email address accuracy — verify you entered it correctly during registration
4. Delivery time — allow up to 10 minutes for email delivery

**Request New Verification Email**

Log in to your account, click the "Resend Verification Email" button in the notification banner, and check your inbox again.

**Additional Steps**

If problems persist, add noreply@skillbridge.com to your contacts, check your email provider's blocked senders list, or contact support for assistance.

## Password Security

### Password Requirements

Your password must meet these security standards:

- Minimum 8 characters in length
- At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
- At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
- At least one number (0-9)
- At least one special character (!@#$%^&*)

### Password Strength Guidelines

**Recommended Practices**

Use unique passwords for each service, combine random words with numbers and symbols, create memorable but non-obvious combinations, and consider passphrases like "Coffee#Makes2024Better!"

**Avoid These Common Mistakes**

Do not use personal information such as birthdates or names, avoid reusing passwords from other sites, never use common passwords like "Password123!", and never share your password with anyone.

## Account Security

### Multi-Factor Authentication

Enable MFA for enhanced account protection:

1. Navigate to Settings → Security in your account dashboard
2. Click Enable Two-Factor Authentication
3. Choose your preferred method: Authenticator App (Google Authenticator, Authy) or SMS Text Message
4. Follow the provided setup instructions
5. Save backup codes in a secure location

### Security Best Practices

- Enable multi-factor authentication for maximum protection
- Use strong, unique passwords for each service
- Never share your account credentials
- Always log out from shared or public devices
- Review login activity regularly in account settings
- Update passwords periodically (every 3-6 months recommended)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Registration Issues

**Email Already Registered**

This email address is already associated with an account. Try signing in instead of signing up, use the Forgot Password feature to recover access, or contact support if you believe this is an error.

**Verification Link Expired**

Verification links expire after 24 hours for security. Request a new verification email from your account dashboard, and the new link will be sent immediately.

**Invalid Email Format**

Ensure your email address follows the standard format (name@domain.com), check for typos or extra spaces, and note that some special characters may not be supported.

**Weak Password Error**

Your password doesn't meet security requirements. Review the password requirements section above, add uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, and consider increasing length to 12+ characters for better security.

## Privacy & Data Protection

### Data Collection

During registration, SkillBridge collects:

- Name and email address
- Account type selection
- Encrypted password (never stored in plain text)
- IP address for security purposes

### Data Usage

Your information is used to create and maintain your account, send important notifications, improve platform services, and prevent fraud and abuse.

### Your Rights

You have the right to access your personal data, request data correction, delete your account and associated data, export your data in standard formats, and opt out of marketing communications.

For complete details, review our Privacy Policy.
