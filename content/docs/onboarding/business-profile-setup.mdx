**About Community Garden Initiative**

Community Garden Initiative (CGI) is a grassroots nonprofit dedicated to transforming underutilized urban spaces into vibrant community gardens that provide fresh produce, environmental education, and social connection. Founded in 2015, we've established 23 gardens across the metro area, serving over 5,000 residents annually.

Our mission is to combat food insecurity while building stronger, more sustainable communities. We believe everyone deserves access to fresh, healthy food and that community gardens are powerful catalysts for neighborhood transformation, environmental stewardship, and social equity. Our work addresses food access, community health, and climate resilience simultaneously.

What makes CGI unique is our holistic, community-driven approach. Beyond planting vegetables, we offer youth education programs, cooking workshops, master gardener training, and regular community events. Our gardens serve as gathering spaces where diverse neighbors connect, learn, and grow together. Last year, our gardens produced over 12,000 pounds of fresh produce, with 80% donated to local food banks and meal programs.

Students working with CGI gain diverse experience in nonprofit operations, community engagement, environmental sustainability, and social impact work. Projects range from marketing and communications to program development, data analysis, and event planning. Many of our student contributors have developed their experiences into full AmeriCorps positions, graduate research opportunities, or careers in the nonprofit sector.

If you're passionate about environmental justice, community development, or food access, we'd love to work with you. Check out our current project opportunities and help us grow healthier, more connected communities, one garden at a time.

Specificity helps qualified students self-select and increases application quality.

Adjust these settings based on your current capacity to engage with students and manage projects.
