### Example: Nonprofit Organization

```
About Community Garden Initiative

Community Garden Initiative (CGI) is a grassroots nonprofit dedicated 
to transforming urban spaces into vibrant community gardens that 
provide fresh produce, environmental education, and social connection. 
Founded in 2015, we've established 23 gardens across the metro area, 
serving over 5,000 residents annually.

Our mission is to combat food insecurity while building stronger, 
more sustainable communities. We believe that everyone deserves 
access to fresh, healthy food and that community gardens are powerful 
catalysts for neighborhood transformation, environmental stewardship, 
and social equity.

What makes CGI unique is our holistic approach. Beyond just planting 
vegetables, we offer youth education programs, cooking workshops, 
master gardener training, and community events. Our gardens serve as 
gathering spaces where diverse neighbors connect, learn, and grow 
together. Last year, our gardens produced over 12,000 pounds of fresh 
produce, with 80% donated to local food banks.

Students working with CGI gain diverse experience in nonprofit 
operations, community engagement, environmental sustainability, and 
social impact work. Projects range from marketing and communications 
to program development, data analysis, and event planning. Many of 
our student contributors have developed their projects into full 
AmeriCorps positions or careers in the nonprofit sector.

If you're passionate about environmental justice, community 
development, or food access, we'd love to work with you! Check out 
our current project opportunities and help us grow healthier 
communities, one garden at a time.
