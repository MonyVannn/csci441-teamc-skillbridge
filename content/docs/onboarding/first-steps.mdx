Regularly update your skills section as you learn new capabilities. Add completed projects to your portfolio promptly. Actively seek feedback from organizations after applications and projects. Continuously improve your approach based on responses and outcomes.

### Maintain Professional Communication

Respond to messages promptly, ideally within 24 hours. Use professional, clear language in all communications. Ask clarifying questions when requirements are unclear. Provide regular progress updates during active projects.

## Common First-Day Mistakes to Avoid

<Tabs items={["Students", "Businesses"]}>
<Tab value="Students">

### Avoid These Common Pitfalls

**Rushing Applications Without Customization**
Taking time to craft thoughtful, personalized applications significantly increases your success rate. Generic applications rarely succeed.

**Applying with Incomplete Profile**
Achieve at least 80% profile completion before submitting applications. Organizations prioritize candidates with complete, professional profiles.

**Over-Committing to Too Many Projects**
Start with 2-3 well-matched opportunities rather than applying to everything. Focus ensures quality applications and realistic workload management.

**Ignoring Skill Requirements**
Apply to projects matching your current skill level rather than aspirational roles. Starting with appropriate challenges builds confidence and success.

</Tab>

<Tab value="Businesses">

### Avoid These Common Pitfalls

**Posting Vague or Overly Broad Projects**
Create specific, well-scoped project descriptions with clear boundaries and deliverables. Vague projects receive fewer quality applications.

**Setting Unrealistic Expectations**
Provide appropriate mentorship and support rather than expecting professional-level output without guidance. Students are learning and need structure.

**Responding Slowly to Student Inquiries**
Reply within 24-48 hours to maintain student engagement and interest. Delayed responses often result in losing top candidates to other opportunities.

**Posting Projects Before Completing Profile**
Complete your organization profile fully before posting projects. Complete profiles build trust and significantly increase application rates.
