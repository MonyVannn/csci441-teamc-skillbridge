✅ **Instead**: Achieve 80%+ completion before applying

❌ **Over-Committing**: Applying to too many projects at once  
✅ **Instead**: Start with 2-3 well-matched opportunities

❌ **Ignoring Requirements**: Applying to projects you're not qualified for  
✅ **Instead**: Focus on projects matching your current skill level

#### For Businesses
❌ **Vague Projects**: Posting unclear or overly broad projects  
✅ **Instead**: Create specific, well-scoped project descriptions

❌ **Unrealistic Expectations**: Expecting professional output without support  
✅ **Instead**: Provide mentorship and realistic project scope
