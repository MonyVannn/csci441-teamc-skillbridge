## Availability Settings

### Why Availability Matters

Setting clear availability helps organizations understand:
- How much time you can dedicate to projects
- When you're able to start and complete work
- What working arrangements suit you best
- Your schedule constraints and preferences

### Time Commitment Options

Select the weekly hours you can realistically commit to project work:

- **5-10 hours/week**: Suitable for side projects alongside full course load
- **10-15 hours/week**: Moderate commitment for substantial contributions
- **15-20 hours/week**: Significant involvement for major project roles
- **20+ hours/week**: Near full-time commitment during breaks or lighter semesters

<Callout title="Be Realistic" type="warn">
Over-committing leads to poor project outcomes and damages your reputation. Account for coursework, other commitments, and personal time when setting availability.
</Callout>

### Availability Period

**Start Date**: Indicate when you can begin new projects
**End Date**: Specify when your availability changes (graduation, semester end, summer break)

Update these dates regularly to reflect your current situation. Organizations appreciate accurate, up-to-date availability information.

### Work Preferences

**Remote Work**: Work entirely from your location
**Hybrid**: Combination of remote and in-person collaboration
**In-Person**: Prefer local organizations with physical office presence
**Flexible Schedule**: Work hours can vary based on your availability
**Fixed Schedule**: Specific hours when you're available to work

Organizations search for candidates using specific terms. Optimize your profile by:

- Adding relevant technical terminology in your bio and experience descriptions

### Professional Personality

Balance professionalism with authenticity:

### Regular Updates

Maintain profile currency:

### Pre-Publication Review

2. Test every portfolio link to ensure it loads correctly
3. Verify your profile photo displays clearly and professionally
4. Read your bio aloud to ensure it sounds natural
5. Ask a friend, mentor, or career advisor to review for feedback

## Privacy Settings

### Profile Visibility Options

**Public Profile:**
- Visible to all organizations on the platform
- Appears in search results and browsing pages
- Maximum exposure to project opportunities
- Anyone can view your profile information

**Limited Profile:**
- Only organizations you apply to can view full details
- Not indexed in public search results
- Greater privacy control
- Fewer unsolicited project invitations

### Information Visibility

**Always Public (regardless of privacy settings):**
- Display name
- Profile photo thumbnail
- General location (city and state)
- Skill categories and count

**Privacy-Controlled Information:**
- Full biographical information
- Detailed work experience descriptions
- Complete education details with GPA
- Portfolio links and external accounts
- Full contact information
- Availability specifics

<Callout title="Finding the Balance" type="info">
Public profiles receive more opportunities but require comfort with information sharing. Limited profiles offer privacy while still allowing you to apply to projects that interest you.
</Callout>

## Next Steps

After completing your profile:

1. **Review Your Profile**: Check for completeness, accuracy, and professional presentation
2. **Browse Available Projects**: Explore opportunities matching your skills and interests
3. **Prepare Application Materials**: Draft cover letter templates and gather references
4. **Understand the Application Process**: Familiarize yourself with how project applications work
5. **Set Up Notifications**: Configure alerts for new projects matching your criteria

Your profile is a living document that grows with your experience. Plan to update it regularly as you complete projects, learn new skills, and gain experience through the platform.

Remember: Quality matters more than quantity. A focused, well-written profile with 5 strong skills beats a scattered profile listing 20 skills you barely know.
