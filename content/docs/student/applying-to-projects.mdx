### Example: Web Development Project

```
Dear TechForward Team,

I'm excited to apply for the Homepage Redesign project. As a junior 
Computer Science student with a focus on web development and UX 
design, I'm drawn to this opportunity to create user-centered 
solutions for a real business.

I have strong experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, having built 
three responsive websites for local small businesses through my 
university's service-learning program. I'm particularly proficient 
in React and have experience integrating WordPress backends. My 
recent project reduced a client's bounce rate by 35% through improved 
navigation and mobile optimization. You can see my work at 
github.com/username or myportfolio.com.

For this project, I would start by analyzing your current analytics 
and conducting a brief competitive review. I'd then create wireframes 
for your feedback before moving to development. I can commit 12 hours 
per week and complete the project within the 8-week timeline, with 
progress updates every two weeks.

I'm enthusiastic about contributing to TechForward's mission and 
would love to discuss how I can help achieve your engagement goals. 
Thank you for considering my application!

Best regards,
[Your Name]

### Example: Marketing Project

```
Hi Community Garden Initiative team,

I'm writing to apply for the Social Media Content Calendar project. 
As a Marketing major passionate about nonprofit work and environmental 
sustainability, this opportunity perfectly aligns with my career goals.

I've completed coursework in Digital Marketing, Social Media Strategy, 
and Content Creation, earning a 3.8 GPA in my major. Last semester, I 
managed social media for a student environmental organization, growing 
our Instagram following from 200 to 1,200 in four months through 
consistent, engaging content. I'm skilled in Canva, Hootsuite, and 
analytics tools. My portfolio of past social campaigns is available 
at linkedin.com/in/username.

My approach would involve researching your target audience and 
analyzing competitor social presence, then creating a content 
calendar aligned with your mission and seasonal activities. I'd 
focus on authentic storytelling that showcases your community impact. 
I can dedicate 10 hours per week for the 12-week project duration.

I'd be honored to help CGI amplify its important work. Please let me 
know if you need any additional information!

Best,
[Your Name]
```

## Customization is Key

### Generic vs. Customized

**❌ Generic Application:**
```
"I'm interested in your project because I want to gain experience.

```

**Why it fails:**
- Could apply to any project
- No specific details
- Doesn't address organization's needs
- Shows minimal effort

**✅ Customized Application:**
```
"Your nonprofit's focus on food justice resonates deeply with me. The 
Social Media Content Calendar project is perfect because I can combine 
my marketing skills with my passion for sustainable agriculture. Having 
managed content for a similar community organization, I understand the 
balance needed between education, engagement, and calls-to-action."
