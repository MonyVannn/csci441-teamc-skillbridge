### Application Examples

<Tabs items={['Web Development Example', 'Marketing Example']}>
  <Tab value="Web Development Example">
    ```
    Dear TechForward Team,

    I'm excited to apply for the Homepage Redesign project. As a junior 
    Computer Science student with a focus on web development and UX 
    design, I'm drawn to this opportunity to create user-centered 
    solutions for a real business.

    I have strong experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, having built 
    three responsive websites for local small businesses through my 
    university's service-learning program. I'm particularly proficient 
    in React and have experience integrating WordPress backends. My 
    recent project reduced a client's bounce rate by 35% through improved 
    navigation and mobile optimization. You can see my work at 
    github.com/username or myportfolio.com.

    For this project, I would start by analyzing your current analytics 
    and conducting a brief competitive review. I'd then create wireframes 
    for your feedback before moving to development. I can commit 12 hours 
    per week and complete the project within the 8-week timeline, with 
    progress updates every two weeks.

    I'm enthusiastic about contributing to TechForward's mission and 
    would love to discuss how I can help achieve your engagement goals. 
    Thank you for considering my application!

    Best regards,
    [Your Name]

    ```
    Hi Community Garden Initiative team,

    I'm writing to apply for the Social Media Content Calendar project. 
    As a Marketing major passionate about nonprofit work and environmental 
    sustainability, this opportunity perfectly aligns with my career goals.

    I've completed coursework in Digital Marketing, Social Media Strategy, 
    and Content Creation, earning a 3.8 GPA in my major. Last semester, I 
    managed social media for a student environmental organization, growing 
    our Instagram following from 200 to 1,200 in four months through 
    consistent, engaging content. I'm skilled in Canva, Hootsuite, and 
    analytics tools. My portfolio of past social campaigns is available 
    at linkedin.com/in/username.

    My approach would involve researching your target audience and 
    analyzing competitor social presence, then creating a content 
    calendar aligned with your mission and seasonal activities. I'd 
    focus on authentic storytelling that showcases your community impact. 
    I can dedicate 10 hours per week for the 12-week project duration.

    I'd be honored to help CGI amplify its important work. Please let me 
    know if you need any additional information!

    Best,
    [Your Name]
    ```
    
    **Why This Works:** Mission alignment, impressive growth metrics, strategic approach, genuine passion

## Customization is Key

    I'm a hard worker and quick learner. I've taken classes in this area. 
    Please consider me for this opportunity."
    ```
    
    **Why it fails:**
    - Could apply to literally any project

    - Generic buzzwords without substance
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Customized Application (Good)">
    ```
    "Your nonprofit's focus on food justice resonates deeply with me. The 
    Social Media Content Calendar project is perfect because I can combine 
    my marketing skills with my passion for sustainable agriculture. Having 
    managed content for a similar community organization, I understand the 
    balance needed between education, engagement, and calls-to-action."
    ```
    
    **Why it works:**
