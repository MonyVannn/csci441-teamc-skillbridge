## Application Strategy

### How Many Projects?

<Tabs items={['Beginners (First Project)', 'Experienced Students']}>
  <Tab value="Beginners (First Project)">
    **Recommended Approach:**
    - Apply to **3-5 well-matched projects** to balance chances
    - Focus on **quality applications** over quantity
    - Start with **smaller scope projects** (2-4 weeks)
    - Build confidence with achievable wins first
    - Choose projects with **mentorship** opportunities
    
    **Why not more?** Each application should be thoughtfully customized. More applications = lower quality.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Experienced Students">
    **Strategic Approach:**
    - Apply to **2-3 at a time** to manage workload
    - Can handle **larger scope** projects with proven track record
    - Mix **challenging and comfortable** projects for growth
    - Focus on **strategic portfolio building** in target area
    - Leverage past project success in applications
    
    **Balance:** Leave room for unexpected opportunities without overcommitting.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="warn" title="Quality Over Quantity">
  Don't apply to too many projects at once! A customized application to 3 well-matched projects is far more effective than 20 generic applications.
</Callout>

### Timing Your Applications

<Tabs items={['Best Times to Apply', 'What to Avoid']}>
  <Tab value="Best Times to Apply">
    **Optimal Application Timing:**
    - **Within first 3 days of posting** (when organizations are most active)
    - **After thoroughly reviewing** the project details and organization
    - **When you have time** to customize and personalize your application
    - **When your schedule truly allows** for the project commitment
    
    Early applications show enthusiasm, but only if they're thoughtful and well-crafted.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="What to Avoid">
    **Poor Timing Indicators:**
    - Applying **minutes after posting** (shows you didn't read carefully)
    - **Last-minute applications** near deadline (appears desperate)
    - Applying **when overcommitted** to other projects or coursework
    - **Hasty applications** without proper preparation or customization
    
    Organizations can tell when applications are rushed or poorly timed.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Search Tips & Tricks

### Finding Hidden Gems

<Callout type="info" title="Look for These Opportunities">
  - **Recently posted projects** (less competition, more responsive organizations)
  - **Smaller organizations** (often provide more mentorship and flexibility)
  - **Clear, detailed postings** (indicates well-organized, professional organizations)
  - **Mission-driven nonprofits** (meaningful work, strong learning focus)
  - **Niche technical requirements** (less competition if you have the skills)
</Callout>

### Advanced Search

<Tabs items={['Example Combinations', 'Filter Strategies']}>
  <Tab value="Example Combinations">
    **Effective Search Combinations:**
    
    ```
    "React" + Web Development + Remote + 10-15 hrs/week
    → Frontend projects with moderate time commitment
    
    "Marketing" + Nonprofit + Paid + Flexible timeline
    → Compensated marketing work with adaptable schedule
    
    "Python" + Data Science + Beginner-friendly
    → Entry-level data projects to build skills
    
    "UI/UX" + Design + Portfolio piece
    → Visual design work to showcase creativity
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Filter Strategies">
    **Strategic Filtering:**
    - Start with **category**, then add **specific skills**
    - Filter by **hours/week** that fit your schedule
    - Use **compensation** filter based on your needs
    - Add **location** preference last for flexibility
    - Save successful combinations for future searches
    
    **Pro Tip:** Remove one filter at a time if results are too narrow.
