## Common Questions

### How do I find my first project?

**Start with:**
1. Complete your profile to 80%+
2. Browse projects in your skill area
3. Apply to 3-5 well-matched opportunities
4. Start with smaller, beginner-friendly projects
5. Focus on quality over quantity in applications

### What if I don't have much experience?

<Callout type="info" title="Limited Experience? That's Okay!">
  Many projects are designed for students with limited experience:
  - Look for "beginner-friendly" or "entry-level" projects
  - Highlight relevant coursework and academic projects
  - Include school projects in your portfolio
  - Show enthusiasm and willingness to learn
  - Emphasize soft skills (communication, teamwork, problem-solving)
</Callout>

### How many projects should I apply to?

<Callout type="warn" title="Recommended Application Strategy">
  **Beginners:** 3-5 well-matched projects  
  **After first project:** 2-3 at a time  
  **Never:** Apply to everything just to increase chances
  
  Quality applications to matched projects win over generic mass applications.
</Callout>

### How long before I hear back?

**Typical timeline:**
- Applications reviewed: 3-7 days
- Interview invitations: 1-2 weeks
- Final decision: 1-2 weeks after application

Some organizations respond faster, others may take longer.
