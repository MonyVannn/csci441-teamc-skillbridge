- Reliability and commitment

## Common Questions

### How do I find my first project?

**Start with:**
1. Complete your profile to 80%+
2. Browse projects in your skill area
3. Apply to 3-5 well-matched opportunities
4. Start with smaller, beginner-friendly projects
5. Focus on quality over quantity in applications

### What if I don't have much experience?

**That's okay!** Many projects are designed for students with limited experience:
- Look for "beginner-friendly" or "entry-level" projects
- Highlight relevant coursework
- Include school projects in your portfolio
- Show enthusiasm and willingness to learn
- Emphasize soft skills (communication, teamwork, etc.)

### How many projects should I apply to?

**Recommended approach:**
- **Beginners**: 3-5 well-matched projects
- **After first project**: 2-3 at a time
- **Never**: Apply to everything just to increase chances

Quality applications to matched projects win over generic mass applications.

### How long before I hear back?

**Typical timeline:**
- Applications reviewed: 3-7 days
- Interview invitations: 1-2 weeks
- Final decision: 1-2 weeks after application

Some organizations respond faster, others may take longer.
